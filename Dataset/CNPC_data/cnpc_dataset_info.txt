The Canvas Network Person-Course (CNPC) open dataset is available at this link: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/1XORAL&version=2.0.
  Canvas Network is a US-based global platform that offers different open courses in different disciplines. The CNPC dataset comprises more than 325K total records of 224,914 users, with each record capturing a single user's activity within one of the 238 open courses that were offered from January 2014 to September 2015. 
  In this dataset, we have retained users with at least five interactions, which removes a significant amount of data since many users interacted with fewer courses. But it helps us to model user-course interactions effectively to provide further recommendations. 
  After preprocessing, we have 56,783 interactions of 6,717 users with 238 courses. 
  We use two side information about courses: 10 disciplines (categories) of courses and course length (in days). Course description or concepts are not provided for this dataset. We split the CNPC dataset similarly to the MOOCCube dataset (72:8:20 ratio).
