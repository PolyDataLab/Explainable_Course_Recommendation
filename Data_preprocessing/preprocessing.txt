The university dataset contains the course registration history of 3328 students, 618 unique courses, and 58,803 student-course interactions. We remove the less frequent courses that appeared less than 3 times all over the dataset. We split the dataset into train, validation, and test sets, where we use the last 3 semesters' data for testing, the previous 3 semesters' data for validation, and the rest of the data for training. 
  Overall, we have student-course interactions over semesters and course descriptions for our university dataset.  Some of the methods developed for MOOCs also use concepts. So, we need to generate some keywords for each course based on the course descriptions. 
  So, after preprocessing, we use a chatbot of a large language model (GPT4o\footnote{{https://openai.com/index/hello-gpt-4o/}}) to extract 5-10 meaningful course concepts by providing course names and descriptions as prompts. We use the following prompt: 
  \textit{Assume that you are a concept extractor from the textual data. You are given the course code, course name, and course description. Your task is to extract a list of 5 to 10 concepts for each course from the course descriptions and your knowledge base.}                                                                                       

For the Ta-Feng dataset, we utilize user-item interactions and side information of items (product categories and sales prices). To be consistent with the literature, we remove a user's history with fewer than three sessions. 
We split the dataset into the train, validation, and test sets, where we take out 20% users for testing their last basket as target basket, and from remaining 80%, we use 90\% for training, and $10$\% for validation and model selection; the split ratio is 72:8:20. 
After preprocessing, there are 3,881 unique items and 1,097 categories of items, and we classify the sales price into 3 categories (low, medium, and high). We have 14,066, 1,125, and 2,813 instances in the training, validation, and test sets.

The MOOCCube dataset contains over 700 MOOC courses, 200k students, and 100k concepts with 300k relation instances that spans from 2017 to 2019. We have preprocessed the MOOCCube data to better model users and courses by filtering out users with few interactions. Specifically, we retained users with more than five interactions and courses with more than ten interactions in our work. 
  After preprocessing, we have 34,916 students, 698 courses, and 273,072 student-course interactions. This dataset is split into an 80:20 ratio to use 20\% courses of each user for testing and 80\% courses for training. We use 10\% of the training data for validation purposes.

The CNPC dataset comprises more than 325K total records of 224,914 users, with each record capturing a single user's activity within one of the 238 open courses that were offered from January 2014 to September 2015. In this dataset, we have retained users with at least five interactions, which removes a significant amount of data since many users interacted with fewer courses. But it helps us to model user-course interactions effectively to provide further recommendations. 
  After preprocessing, we have 56,783 interactions of 6,717 users with 238 courses. 
  We use two side information about courses: 10 disciplines (categories) of courses and course length (in days). Course description or concepts are not provided for this dataset. We split the CNPC dataset similarly to the MOOCCube dataset.
