Best configuration of hyperparameters for our proposed KGXCR model:
for GAT module: number of GAT layers = 1, embedding dimension = 128, number of epochs = 400, learning rate = 0.001, number of heads = 4, edge dropout = 0, node dropout = 0, threshold_weight_edges_iw (course-keyword) = 0.1, threshold_weight_edges_cc (course-course) = 0.1
For GRU module: number of GRU layers = 3, dropout = 0.5, learning rate = 0.01.
